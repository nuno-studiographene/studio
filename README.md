# Firebase Studio

Tekura turns your user flows or feature descriptions into real-time architecture diagrams with technical questions and suggestions. Spend less time planning and even less time building.

Our chatbot asks pertinant and relevant technical questions, so that you can plan the entire architecture (front-end and back-end) of your project. This makes it much easier to estimate projects and foresee any complications that might appear in the future.
In the end a flowchart is created so that the developers and technical architects can better understand and estimate the project, making it easier and faster to build.

We used firebase studio to build our app using only prompts and no code.
Gemini is being used for the chatbot.
Mermaid package was used for the diagrams
